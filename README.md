# project3-scout-47
It's a 3 man first "real" client project for Scout47.

After git cloning the project (dev branch at the moment) you will have 3 folders and for them to work you need to follow these steps :

Installations + preparations inside each of the folders

- Web-mobile : 
  + Need to install Expo CLI to run the project
  + npm start (starting the project)
  
- Web-server : 
  + Create a .env file with your database informations (name, localhost, DataBase Name,...)
  + npm install (installing all packages in package JSON)
  + npm/nodemon start (starting the project, nodemon only if you added "start": "nodemon <file name>" in package JSON) 
  
- Web-app : 
  + npm install (installing all packages in package JSON)
  + npm start (starting the project)
  
The project is still in development.

Team Scout47.
